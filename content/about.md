![](/images/avatar.png#avatar-about)

I am working as a postdoctoral scientist, lecturer and teaching assistant at the [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/de.html), [Institute of Geodesy and Photogrammetry](https://igp.ethz.ch/) in the group of [Geosensors and Engineering Geodesy](https://gseg.igp.ethz.ch/) led by [Prof. Dr. Andreas Wieser](https://gseg.igp.ethz.ch/people/group-head/prof-dr--andreas-wieser.html).

I am passionate about collecting and processing geospatial data using various geodetic and geophysical measurement systems. I have extensive experience studying, using, and teaching with GNSS, total stations, levels, terrestrial laser scanners, cameras, gravimeters, and magnetometers.

## Projects
I am working on projects funded by the European Organization for Nuclear Research ([CERN](https://espace.cern.ch/SU/default.aspx)) and the Swiss Federal Office of Topography ([Swisstopo](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/de/wissen-fakten/geodaesie-vermessung.html)).

## Interests and Activities

My broad interests are in geospatial sciences. I am constantly learning about novel theoretical findings which one can use in practical applications. Topic-wise I am mostly focused on engineering, satellite, physical, and geometric geodesy. These branches have an enormous potential in other academic disciplines and industries. I have been working on interdisciplinary projects with professionals from geophysics, geoinformatics, agriculture, robotics, civil engineering and architecture.

My specific interests are in:
- geodetic reference systems (terrestrial, celestial, height and time);
- geospatial data collection, processing, integration, analysis, and interpretation using GNSS, total station, level, terrestrial laser scanner, laser tracker, camera, radar, gravimeter, and magnetometer;
- high-precision GNSS, geodynamics and navigation;
- geodetic networks;
- 3D reality digitization and modelling;
- geodetic monitoring of infrastructural, industrial and environmental objects;
- gravity and magnetic field modelling at local and regional spatial scales;
- geoid modelling at local and regional spatial scales.

### Research portfolio
- geoid and gravity field models of Europe, Republic of Croatia, France (Auvergne), Colorado (USA), Mediterranean Sea;
- proposal for the modernization of the Croatian height reference system;
- development of geodetic reference system transformation algorithms, workflows and software, including distortion modelling, for several areas worldwide;
- post-seismic crustal deformation analysis, following 2020 Zagreb and Petrinja's earthquakes (Republic of Croatia);
- 3D models of the cultural heritage sites;
- geomagnetic network establishment and surveying for the territory of the Republic of Croatia;
- geomagnetic network design of Switzerland;
- concept design of the coordinate reference systems for the CERN Future Circular Collider (FCC);
- concept design of the surface and underground geodetic networks for the CERN FCC;
- concept for calibration, control and testing of the geodetic equipment for the CERN FCC;
- GNSS smartphone positioning and navigation in different conditions and areas (several datasets in Slovakia and the USA).

### Academic and industry collaborations

I have been involved in research and development (R&D) and consultancy projects as the principal or assisting researcher. Additionally, I perform target-specific lecturing, training and capacity building for industry staff coming from different fields and backgrounds.
