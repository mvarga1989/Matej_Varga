## Introduction
I am working as a postdoctoral scientist, lecturer and teaching assistant at the [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/de.html), [Institute of Geodesy and Photogrammetry](https://igp.ethz.ch/) in the group of [Geosensors and Engineering Geodesy](https://gseg.igp.ethz.ch/) led by [Prof. Dr. Andreas Wieser](https://gseg.igp.ethz.ch/people/group-head/prof-dr--andreas-wieser.html).

I am passionate about collecting, analyzing, integration and interpretation of geospatial data from different measurement systems. I have extensive experience with geodetic and geophysical instruments, including GNSS, total stations, levels, terrestrial laser scanners, RGB cameras, gravimeters, and magnetometers.

## Interests and Activities

My broadest professional interests are in **geospatial sciences**. I am constantly developing and studying **novel theoretical findings** which can be implemented in **practical applications**. Topic-wise I am mostly focused on **engineering**, **satellite**, **physical**, and **geometric geodesy**. These branches have an enormous potential in other academic disciplines and industries. I have been working on interdisciplinary projects with professionals from geophysics, geoinformatics, agriculture, robotics, civil engineering and architecture.

My **specific interests** are in:
- geodetic reference systems (terrestrial, celestial, height and time);
- geospatial data collection, processing, integration, analysis, and interpretation using GNSS, total station, level, terrestrial laser scanner, laser tracker, camera, radar, gravimeter, and magnetometer;
- high-precision GNSS, geodynamics and navigation;
- geodetic networks;
- 3D reality digitization and modelling;
- geodetic monitoring of infrastructural, industrial and environmental objects;
- gravity and magnetic field modelling at local and regional spatial scales;
- geoid modelling at local and regional spatial scales.

## Research portfolio
My research contributions are:
- geoid and gravity field models of Europe, Republic of Croatia, France (Auvergne), Colorado (USA), Mediterranean Sea;
- proposal for the modernization of the Croatian height reference system;
- development of geodetic reference system transformation algorithms, workflows and software, including distortion modelling, for several areas worldwide;
- post-seismic crustal deformation analysis, following 2020 Zagreb and Petrinja's earthquakes (Republic of Croatia);
- 3D models of the cultural heritage sites (e.g. Lausanne Cathedral, Kreuzkirche);
- geomagnetic network establishment and surveying for the territory of the Republic of Croatia;
- geomagnetic network design of Switzerland;
- concept design of the coordinate reference systems for the CERN Future Circular Collider (FCC);
- concept design of the surface and underground geodetic networks for the CERN FCC;
- concept for calibration, control and testing of the geodetic equipment for the CERN FCC;
- GNSS smartphone positioning and navigation in different conditions and areas (several datasets in Slovakia and the USA).

## Projects

I am involved in projects supported by the European Organization for Nuclear Research ([CERN](https://espace.cern.ch/SU/default.aspx)) and the Swiss Federal Office of Topography ([Swisstopo](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/de/wissen-fakten/geodaesie-vermessung.html)).


## Academic and industry collaborations

My expertise extends beyond scientific research and lecturing. I am providing **specific lectures**, **training**, and **capacity building** to help **professionals from diverse backgrounds** improve geomatics, geodesy and land surveying knowledge and practical skills.
