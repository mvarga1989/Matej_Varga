## Supervising students and researchers

I am accepting the supervision of responsible and motivated internal (ETHZ) and external students at the BSc, MSc, and PhD levels.

Topics are not necessarily predetermined and can be adapted to student's preferences and ideas. Most of the topics can be taken as either a Bachelor's or Master’s thesis, or adapted as a Master's project.

**Interested?** Reach out via [:e-mail:](mailto:vargam@ethz.ch?Subject=Thesis%20inquiry)

### Own topics

If you have an idea and wish to pursue your topic within my research scope, please send me a brief research plan.
