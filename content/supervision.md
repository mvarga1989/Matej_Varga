title = "Supervision of students and researchers"
+++

I am happy to accept supervision of responsible and motivated internal (ETHZ) and external students at the **BSc**, **MSc**, and **PhD** levels.

Topics are **not predetermined** and **can be adapted to student's preferences** and ideas. If you have an idea and wish to pursue your topic within my research scope, please prepare a brief research plan.

Most of the topics can be taken as a Bachelor's, Master’s thesis, or even adapted as a Master's project.

**Interested?** Reach out via [:e-mail:](mailto:vargam@ethz.ch?Subject=Thesis%20inquiry)
